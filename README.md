NodaTime.Humanization
=====================

Humanization add-on for Noda Time.  Provides human readable strings such as "an hour ago".


### Status

- In development.  Version 0.0.1-alpha.
- Need to add *many* more unit tests.

### Known issues 

- Only single-unit terms like "2.5 years" should have decimals.  
  Values like "2 years and 3.2 months" should just say "2 years and 3 months".
